    "Generate a poorly formatted CSV file that needs to be reconfigured into a useful form.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenario for the tutorial is that of a lab that has datasets generated in a format that is suboptimal for analyzing/plotting and the data scientist needs to change the format so to analyze the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **input format** provided is: \n",
    "  - Data are in CSV files in a non useful format \n",
    "  - Column for Young Female one for Young male, one for Old female, one for Old male\n",
    "\n",
    "The input format is trial/condition by row. The format looks like the following\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "| male wild type | female wild type | male mutant | female mutant |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "|nums | nums | num | num |\n",
    "\n",
    "Below an example dataset from the lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "| male wild type | female wild type | male mutant | female mutant |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| 10 | 5 | 4 | 10 |\n",
    "| 23 | 4 | 22 | 33 |\n",
    "| 22 | 23 | 5 | 33 |\n",
    "| 11 | 25 | 5 | 4 |\n",
    "\n",
    "The **output format** is a 3 columns format first colum data x subjects, second column level of factor one, third column level of factor 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The final format of the data should be reoarganized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data | Sex | Strain | \n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| 0-100 | M/F | Wild Type / Mutant |\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know that the ra N measurements. \n",
    "Then we can use if then to find the labels and we can reassign the labels into the oroper colum/var type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there is no reandomization on the data as thye come from the experiemnts it is very easy to reorganize the clumns in **input** to the correspoding labels in **output**\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a video of the dataset and changes needed to jus liek the one captured from larry\n",
    "\n",
    "Given them a last qustion with a different dataset to basiclly do the same thing but slightly different (the input is transposed row/columns)"
